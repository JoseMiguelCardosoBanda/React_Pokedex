# React Pokédex App

#### This project was created using React 18.2.0, as well the React Hooks: useState, useEffect; and the React icons library.
#### The IDE used was Visual Studio Code.
#### Also, all the displayed information was retrieved from the PokéAPI RESTful API.

## Explaining the App

At first, the app shows a list that contains all the existing pokémon from the Red and Blue games to the recent Scarlet and Violet games,
they are all ordered by their national pokédex entry number in a card format, where an image and some of their characteristics as their type, 
height and weight can be found.

### The Buttons on the Navbar

The buttons that are placed in the navbar, contain one of the eighteen types that exists, when the user clicks one of them,
the list will change, and now it will show all the pokémon that have the type that was clicked, also at the left side it can be seen how many
pokémon have that type, for example, if the user clicks on the psychic button, it will display the list of all the pokémon that have the psychic type.

Note: The images only display some pokémon for the example.

Also, when a type button is clicked, all the other buttons disappear and the only button which can be seen is the "see all" button,
so the user go back to the complete list before he can click another button.

### The Cards

As the list shows up, it can be seen that all the pokémon have their information and image in a little card, so, to see more info about a
certain pokémon, when the user clicks a card from the list, a popup with more info will be displayed.

As can be seen in the image, the popup displays the entry number of the pokédex for the pokémon, the type, it origin region, the abilities that the
pokémon can have in the games that it appears, a media player that plays the pokémon's cry, also, the image is interactive, when the user clicks it,
the image changes to the shiny version of the pokémon, when the mouse hovers the image, the hint is displayed.
